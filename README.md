# Edgar

Open-Source iOS game “Edgar The Explorer”.

![iOS icon](/Media.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/icon-01%403x.png?raw=true "Edgar The Explorer App Icon")

All assets are now online, except:

– JSTileMap, which you can find here: https://github.com/slycrel/JSTileMap

– The Creative Commons music. You can find Juno by Chronox here: http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Chronox_2/Voyager/Chronox_-_03_-_Juno (CC-BY), which should be renamed Juno.mp3, and the End Game tune here: https://soundcloud.com/arandompersona/x-files-theme-8bit, which should be renamed EndGame.mp3. Both files go in a folder named "Sounds" in the project folder.

We are still looking for appropriate App Store-compatible GPL and Creative Commons licences. Any help would be grealty appreciated.

Best

Filipe & Paul
