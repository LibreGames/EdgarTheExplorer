Apple authorized the external testing [using TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) on Saturday, June 4. We're getting really excited!

Three great, much more advanced FOSS iPhone games we love:

* 2048 (MIT) https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048

* Dungeon Story (MIT) https://github.com/pdeligia/dungeonstory-ios

* Puzzles (MIT) https://github.com/ghewgill/puzzles

We are looking for other free/libre iOS games or game makers. Any help is appreciated.

Best
